                    About Unlock Your Tight Hamstrings
                </h1>
                <div>
                    <p class="fw-bold text-red2">Q: How is this different from other stretching programs?</p>
                    <p>A: Most stretching routines only scratch the surface and don’t address the deeper layers of
                        tightness. Rick’s program uses a unique sequence that targets the root causes of stiffness, not
                        just the symptoms. You’ll get guided movements designed to unlock tension that other programs
                        miss, so you feel real, lasting relief.</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold text-red2">Q: What makes Rick’s program stand out?</p>
                    <p>A: What makes Rick’s program stand out is how it focuses on releasing the tightness in your
                        hamstrings layer by layer. Rick’s step-by-step approach is built to target the hidden spots of
                        tension most people ignore. That’s why it’s the fastest way to looser, stronger, healthier legs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-bold text-red2">Q: Why is this so affordable? Is there a catch?</p>
                    <p>A: There’s no catch. We’re proud of how many people have already changed their lives with this
                        program, and we want to make it easy for more people to try it. Plus, we’re celebrating reaching
                        a huge milestone with our HealingThroughMovement.com community, so we’re giving everyone a break
                        on the price.</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold text-red2">Q: How long does the program take?</p>
                    <p>A: It usually takes about 5 minutes from start to finish. You can do it once a day for best
                        results, either before or after a workout or completely on its own.</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold text-red2">Q: How fast will I see results?</p>
                    <p>A: Everyone is different, but many people feel something after their very first session. For
                        others, it might take a few days of practice. It depends on your body, but change often happens
                        fast.</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold text-red2">Q: Who is this program for?</p>
                    <p>A: Anyone who has unexplained back, leg, or joint pain, or who feels stiff and tight from sitting
                        too much. The moves are gentle enough for any fitness level, so you don’t need to worry.</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold text-red2">Q: Can I do this if I’ve had a hamstring injury before?</p>
                    <p>A: That depends on how your injury healed and what your doctor says. Most of these movements are
                        gentle, but it’s always best to ask your doctor first to make sure they’re safe for your
                        situation.</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold text-red2">Q: Can I start right away or do I have to wait for the mail?</p>
                    <p>A: You can start right away. Unlock Your Tight Hamstrings is all digital, so there’s nothing to
                        ship and no waiting.</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold text-red2">Q: Are the exercises hard?</p>
                    <p>A: Not at all. Once you watch the videos, you’ll see how simple they are. And if you want a
                        bigger challenge, there are ways to make them harder too.</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold text-red2">Q: What if it doesn’t work for me?</p>
                    <p>A: We really believe it will work. But if you don’t feel happy with it for any reason, you’ll get
                        a full refund with no questions asked.</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold text-red2">Q: Do I need a gym or special equipment?</p>
                    <p>A: No gym needed. You can do everything at home in a small space, with just a wall for a couple
                        of the moves.</p>
